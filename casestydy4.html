            <h1>Case Study: Internship Projects at ShadowFox</h1>
            <p>
                During my internship at ShadowFox, I was tasked with creating two distinct web projects: a personal
                portfolio website and an IPL team website. These projects allowed me to apply my web development skills
                using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and provided valuable experience in designing and implementing
                interactive and visually appealing websites.
